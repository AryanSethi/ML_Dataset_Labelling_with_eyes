When we step into the world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, we are 
soon introduced to Image classification which personally for me was the most interesting part **BUT**
manually creating image datasets can be a pain in the ass specially when you have to separate 
images in their respective directories from a shuffled dataset. You might say that we can simply use the 
datasets that are already available online like CIFAR and blah blah ! 
I know, but for people like me who want to experiment things by themselves, we have to do it manually atleast once (I did more than once tho :)  )

This is just to attempt to help those people who won't just let it go without trying it out themselves.

## Idea
I'm trying to develope a python based Machine learning based GUI (I made my dataset myself :p) that will help you arrange your image data and separate it using your eyes.
For example, let's say I'm trying to make a classification model that will classify images of cats and dogs. Well obivously I'll first have to create separate directories containing Cat images
and dog images. So from a mixture of images containing both Cat and Dog images, I'll simply use my eye movements to put those unshuffled images into their respective directories. Move your eyes towards
left if its a cat and right if its a dog or however you like it.
